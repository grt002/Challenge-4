# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

We were given the following assignment in the FSF coding course for this project:

<!-- Section below is from the EdEx course -->

"At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment."
